This is a speed reading tool for reaching 500wpm or even more.

It's based on my research on how the brain reads content and how we can improve our ability to read and comprehend medium to low fidelity content faster.

## TODO

create class based design for easier implementation

space bar to play / pause

ability to set wpm in the UI

smarter hyphenation handling, kinda jank rn

develop unit test suite for js code comparing to the original



handling for hyphenated acronyms (G-Force, MAPE-K), these are single words, but are rendered separately

center reading box in middle of page

set text box to optimal width for eye travel

add blurb to bottom in light grey "Inspired by Zethos and Spritzer, coded with <3 by David Awad"


display previous words on pause?

open questions :

optimal word length?
